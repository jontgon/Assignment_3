Hypothesis: There is more land dedicated to forests than cultivated crops in Montana.

I downloaded a dataset of the continental United States containing rasterized land use designation data. I then clipped the dataset in QGIS to generate the map of Montana. I also generated an attribute table containing pixels counts for each land designation type. That attribute table was then extracted from QGIS and analyzed in tableau to render the histogram. That histogram clearly shows that more land is designated to forests than to cultivated crops, thereby proving my hypothesis.
